--- abstract

This draft introduces the Workload Authentication Maturity Level (WAML) framework that enables organizations to assess their current workload authentication mechanisms and progressively strengthen their security posture.

--- middle

# Introduction
The Workload Authentication Maturity Levels (WAML) framework provides a structured approach for organizations to systematically assess and enhance their authentication mechanisms. By offering standardized criteria and incremental levels of improvement, WAML allows organizations to progressively strengthen their security posture, ensuring that their authentication systems are resilient against evolving threats.

# Workload Identity Authentication Levels

## Level 0: No Authentication

### Description:
- No authentication mechanisms are in place.

### Characteristics:
- Machines and workloads operate without any form of authentication.
- No assurance of identity or integrity of dependent services.
- Highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.

### Examples:
No access control or reliance on IP addresses, combined with allow lists and block lists for access control.

## Level 1: Deploy Time Shared-Secret Based Authentication

### Description:
Manual deploy time of simple passwords, shared secrets and API keys without lifecycle management

### Characteristics:
- Use of simple shared secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) deployed manually or at deploy time.
- No unique identification of workloads.
- Minimal automation in credential distribution typically without regular credential rotation.
- Lack of instrumentation on credential lifecycle and governance reporting.
- Highly vulnerable to key compromise and lateral movement of attackers.

### Examples:
Deploy-time shared secrets.

## Level 2: Deploy-Time Credential Based Authentication

### Description:
Static asymmetric key-based authentication and symmetric credential management systems that are deployed during setup.

### Characteristics:
- Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived certificates).
- Minimal automation in credential distribution.
- Basic security policies and procedures in place.
- No reliable credential lifecycle management
- Often no governing authority for credential issuance, leading to issues such as password sprawl and difficulty in governance.

### Examples:
Kerberos key tabs, long-lived tokens.

## Level 3: Automated Authentication with Static Credentials

### Description:
Automated authentication using static credentials and improved logging.

### Characteristics:
- Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived certificates, tokens).
- Improved logging and monitoring capabilities.
- Automated processes for credential distribution.
- Basic security policies and procedures in place.
- Access controls tied to the credential rather than the subject of the credential due to the lack of an issuer/governing authority.

### Examples:
Automated API key distribution, long-lived certificates managed through automation tools.

## Level 4: Dynamic Authentication with Renewable Credentials

### Description:
Dynamic authentication using renewable credentials with moderate automation.

### Characteristics:
- Use of renewable credentials (e.g., short-lived certificates, tokens).
- Automated credential issuance and renewal processes.
- Enhanced logging and monitoring with anomaly detection.
- Regular auditing and compliance checks.

### Examples:
Short-lived tokens issued and renewed automatically, dynamic certificates.

## Level 5: Zero-Trust Principles with Context-Aware Authentication

### Description:
Implementation of zero-trust principles with context-aware authentication.

### Characteristics:
- Use of context-aware, short-lived credentials (e.g., ephemeral certificates, workload identities).
- Continuous authentication and authorization checks based on context (e.g., behavior, location).
- Advanced logging, monitoring, and real-time threat detection.
- Integration with identity management and access control systems.

### Examples:
Ephemeral certificates, workload identities validated against behavioral baselines.

## Level 6: Full Zero-Trust Implementation with End-to-End Security

### Description:
- Comprehensive zero-trust security with end-to-end protections.

### Characteristics:
- End-to-end encryption and mutual authentication for all communications.
- Full implementation of dynamic, context-aware authentication and authorization.
- Automated security policy enforcement and compliance monitoring.
- Robust threat intelligence integration and proactive threat mitigation.
- Continuous improvement and adaptation to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

### Examples:
- Full zero-trust network architecture, real-time threat intelligence integration.
- Naming and Attestation: Ability to identify the combination of machine and workload, with attestation providing assurance of the state of the environment.
