1.  Introduction

   The Workload Authentication Maturity Levels (WAML) framework provides
   a structured approach for organizations to systematically assess and
   enhance their authentication mechanisms.  By offering standardized
   criteria and incremental levels of improvement, WAML allows
   organizations to progressively strengthen their security posture,
   ensuring that their authentication systems are resilient against
   evolving threats.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Workload Identity Authentication Levels

3.1.  Level 0: No Authentication

3.1.1.  Description:

   *  No authentication mechanisms are in place.

3.1.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Machines and workloads operate without any form of authentication.

   *  No assurance of identity or integrity of dependent services.

   *  Highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.

3.1.3.  Examples:

   No access control or reliance on IP addresses, combined with allow
   lists and block lists for access control.

3.2.  Level 1: Deploy Time Shared-Secret Based Authentication

3.2.1.  Description:

   Manual deploy time of simple passwords, shared secrets and API keys
   without lifecycle management

3.2.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Use of simple shared secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) deployed
      manually or at deploy time.

   *  No unique identification of workloads.

   *  Minimal automation in credential distribution typically without
      regular credential rotation.

   *  Lack of instrumentation on credential lifecycle and governance
      reporting.

   *  Highly vulnerable to key compromise and lateral movement of
      attackers.

3.2.3.  Examples:

   Deploy-time shared secrets.

3.3.  Level 2: Deploy-Time Credential Based Authentication

3.3.1.  Description:

   Static asymmetric key-based authentication and symmetric credential
   management systems that are deployed during setup.

3.3.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived certificates).

   *  Minimal automation in credential distribution.

   *  Basic security policies and procedures in place.

   *  No reliable credential lifecycle management

   *  Often no governing authority for credential issuance, leading to
      issues such as password sprawl and difficulty in governance.

3.3.3.  Examples:

   Kerberos key tabs, long-lived tokens.

3.4.  Level 3: Automated Authentication with Static Credentials

3.4.1.  Description:

   Automated authentication using static credentials and improved
   logging.

3.4.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived certificates, tokens).

   *  Improved logging and monitoring capabilities.

   *  Automated processes for credential distribution.

   *  Basic security policies and procedures in place.

   *  Access controls tied to the credential rather than the subject of
      the credential due to the lack of an issuer/governing authority.

3.4.3.  Examples:

   Automated API key distribution, long-lived certificates managed
   through automation tools.

3.5.  Level 4: Dynamic Authentication with Renewable Credentials

3.5.1.  Description:

   Dynamic authentication using renewable credentials with moderate
   automation.

3.5.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Use of renewable credentials (e.g., short-lived certificates,
      tokens).

   *  Automated credential issuance and renewal processes.

   *  Enhanced logging and monitoring with anomaly detection.

   *  Regular auditing and compliance checks.

3.5.3.  Examples:

   Short-lived tokens issued and renewed automatically, dynamic
   certificates.

3.6.  Level 5: Zero-Trust Principles with Context-Aware Authentication

3.6.1.  Description:

   Implementation of zero-trust principles with context-aware
   authentication.

3.6.2.  Characteristics:

   *  Use of context-aware, short-lived credentials (e.g., ephemeral
      certificates, workload identities).

   *  Continuous authentication and authorization checks based on
      context (e.g., behavior, location).

   *  Advanced logging, monitoring, and real-time threat detection.

   *  Integration with identity management and access control systems.

3.6.3.  Examples:

   Ephemeral certificates, workload identities validated against
   behavioral baselines.

3.7.  Level 6: Full Zero-Trust Implementation with End-to-End Security

3.7.1.  Description:

   *  Comprehensive zero-trust security with end-to-end protections.

3.7.2.  Characteristics:

   *  End-to-end encryption and mutual authentication for all
      communications.

   *  Full implementation of dynamic, context-aware authentication and
      authorization.

   *  Automated security policy enforcement and compliance monitoring.

   *  Robust threat intelligence integration and proactive threat
      mitigation.

   *  Continuous improvement and adaptation to emerging threats and
      vulnerabilities.

3.7.3.  Examples:

   *  Full zero-trust network architecture, real-time threat
      intelligence integration.

   *  Naming and Attestation: Ability to identify the combination of
      machine and workload, with attestation providing assurance of the
      state of the environment.
