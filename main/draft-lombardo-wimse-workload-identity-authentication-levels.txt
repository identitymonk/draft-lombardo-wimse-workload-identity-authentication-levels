1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   With the increasing complexity of distributed systems,
   containerization, and cloud-native architectures, machine and
   workload identity has become a critical security cornerstone.  While
   for human identity standards guidance such as [NIST.SP.800-63]
   provides comprehensive frameworks for human identity assurance and
   authentication, there is no equivalent standard for machine and
   workload identities.

   This document defines a framework for Machine Identity Assurance
   Levels (MIAL) and Machine Authentication Assurance Levels (MAAL) to
   establish consistent, verifiable trust in machine-to-machine
   communications.

1.2.  Scope

   This standard addresses: - Machine identity proofing and verification
   requirements - Machine authentication mechanisms and protocols -
   Hardware-based security integration - Supply chain validation
   requirements - Runtime attestation and continuous verification -
   Cross-environment identity federation - Workload identity lifecycle
   management

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined for use in this document:

   *  Machine Identity: A set of unique metadata and identifier
      associated with a hardware device, virtual machine, container, or
      workload.

   *  Workload: A discrete computing task or application running in a
      distributed environment.

   *  Attestation: The process of providing evidence about the state of
      a machine or workload.

   *  Identity Proofing: The process of verifying the claimed identity
      of a machine or workload.

   *  Authentication: The process of verifying the authenticity of a
      machine or workload identity.

3.  Framework Overview

   The Machine Identity Assurance and Authentication Framework consists
   of two primary components:

3.1.  Machine Identity Assurance Levels (MIAL)

   MIAL defines the degree of confidence in the claimed identity of a
   machine or workload.  This includes: - Supply chain validation -
   Identity attestation - Software integrity verification -
   Configuration validation - Deployment environment verification

3.2.  Machine Authentication Assurance Levels (MAAL)

   MAAL defines the strength of an authentication nechanism used by
   workload to authenticate.  This includes:

3.2.1.  Credential provider provenance

   This represents the level of trust in the authenticator.

3.2.2.  Credential enrollment

   This represents the requirements for the credential to exist.

3.2.3.  Credential containment

   This represents the constraints on how and where the credential can
   be stored.

3.2.4.  Credential unlocking

   This represents how the credential can be accessed for authentication
   purposes.

3.2.5.  Credential boundary

   This represents the constraints on where the credential can be used.

3.2.6.  Credential reuse

   This represents if and how one credential exist for more than one
   resource.

3.2.7.  Credential recovery

   This represents the constraints on how the credential can be
   recoevered if somthing goes wrong.

3.2.8.  Credential governance

   This represents the rules that govern the credential lifecycle.

3.2.9.  Level MAAL-0

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
